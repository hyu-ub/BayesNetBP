Description: Belief propagation methods in Bayesian Networks to propagate evidence through the network. The implementation of these methods are based on the article: Cowell, RG (2005). Local Propagation in Conditional Gaussian Bayesian Networks <https://www.jmlr.org/papers/v6/cowell05a.html>. For details please see Yu et. al. (2020) BayesNetBP: An R Package for Probabilistic Reasoning in Bayesian Networks <doi:10.18637/jss.v094.i03>. The optional 'cyjShiny' package for running the Shiny app is available at <https://github.com/cytoscape/cyjShiny>. Please see the example in the help documentation of 'runBayesNetApp' function for installing 'cyjShiny' package from GitHub.
